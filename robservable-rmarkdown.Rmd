```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The robservable R package "allows the use of Observable notebooks (or parts of them) as htmlwidgets in R."

```{r}
library(robservable)
```

```{r}
robservable(
  "@observablehq/test-observable-quarto",
  include = c("staticChart")
)
```

With an input:

```{r}
robservable(
  "@observablehq/test-observable-quarto",
  include = c("viewof dogRadio", "chart")
)
```

With new data (a data frame):

```{r}
# Create a new data frame with the same variable names: 
df = data.frame(name = c("Milo", "Otis", "Scout"), weight = c(20, 11, 42))
```

```{r}
robservable(
  "@observablehq/test-observable-quarto",
  include = c("viewof dogRadio", "chart"),
  input = list(data = df) # Replace data with df
)
```
